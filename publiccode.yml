    longDescription: |
      MUI Italia presents a Material-UI theme enriched by the aesthetics of
      Bootstrap Italia, tailored for application components. It's an integration
      that brings new design elements into Material-UI, offering a seamless
      approach to styling web applications.


      To leverage this package, integrate it into your application via \*npm\*
      or \*yarn\*. The theme acts as a wrapper, overriding default parameters
      like colors, font families, and padding sizes. The goal is to minimize
      custom styles and instead utilize the standard library and this themed
      framework. Notably, it introduces a specific 'Italia' color with a 'blu
      italia palette' for components.


      The CLI commands included in the package.json facilitate various tasks
      like linting, building, running Storybook, and performing checks with
      Chromatic for visual regressions. Storybook serves as a comprehensive
      guide to visualize and interact with the available components.


      Contributions are welcome, emphasizing the creation of versatile, reusable
      components that align with design guidelines. Two paths are outlined for
      contributors: building generic components or composing components using
      the library's existing ones. Key guidelines revolve around visual
      consistency, version control, Storybook/Chromatic integration,
      accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.
